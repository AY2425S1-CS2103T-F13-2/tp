### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/budget/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/budget/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/budget/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `BuyerListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/budget/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Buyer` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/budget/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to the `Abcli Parser` class.
2. The `Abcli Parser` class then creates either a `BuyerCommandParser`, `MeetUpCommandParser`, or `PropertyCommandParser` according to its current mode
3. The created CommandParser then creates another parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command. The type of parser created here is dependent on the CommandParser created in step 2, e.g. a `MeetUpCommandParser` will create a `DeleteCommandParser` for the `MeetUp` class, while a `BuyerCommandParser` will create a `DeleteCommandParser` for the `Buyer` class.
4. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
5. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a buyer).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
6. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `Abcli Parser` class creates a `BMPCommandParser` (`BMP` is a placeholder for the different mode of parsers, either a `BuyerCommandParser`, `MeetUpCommandParser`, or `PropertyCommandParser`). The created BMPCommandParser then creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create an `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AbcliParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g. during testing.
* All `BMPCommandParser` classes (`BuyerCommandParser`, `MeetUpCommandParser`, and `PropertyCommandParser`) extends the `CommandParser` class so that all of them have access to general commands e.g. `HelpCommand`, ...

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/budget/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the buyer list data i.e., all `Buyer` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueBuyerList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Buyer` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Buyer>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `BuyerList`, which `Buyer` references. This allows `BuyerList` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Buyer` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/budget/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both buyer list data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `BuyerListStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.budget.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedBuyerList`. It extends `BuyerList` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `buyerListStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedBuyerList#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current buyer list state in its history.
* `VersionedBuyerList#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous buyer list state from its history.
* `VersionedBuyerList#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone buyer list state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitBuyerList()`, `Model#undoBuyerList()` and `Model#redoBuyerList()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedBuyerList` will be initialized with the initial buyer list state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single buyer list state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th buyer in the buyer list. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitBuyerList()`, causing the modified state of the buyer list after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `buyerListStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted buyer list state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new buyer. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitBuyerList()`, causing another modified buyer list state to be saved into the `buyerListStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitBuyerList()`, so the buyer list state will not be saved into the `buyerListStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the buyer was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoBuyerList()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous buyer list state, and restores the buyer list to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial BuyerList state, then there are no previous BuyerList states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoBuyerList()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoBuyerList()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the buyer list to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `buyerListStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest buyer list state, then there are no undone BuyerList states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoBuyerList()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the buyer list, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitBuyerList()`, `Model#undoBuyerList()` or `Model#redoBuyerList()`. Thus, the `buyerListStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitBuyerList()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `buyerListStateList`, all buyer list states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire buyer list.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the buyer being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Product Details**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

A real estate agent who...
* has a need to manage a significant number of client contacts
* frequently needs to track client information, such as property preferences, deal statuses, and meetings
* hopes to ensure smooth communication with clients by sending updates on listings, reminders for follow-ups, and managing appointments
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Using CLI to streamline management of client contacts and communications will make it more efficient than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. ABCLI should be a result of evolving/enhancing/morphing the given codebase.

1. ABCLI should be targeting users who can type fast and prefer typing over other means of input.

1. ABCLI should be for a single user.

1. ABCLI needs to be developed in a breadth-first incremental manner over the project duration.

1. ABCLI's data should be stored locally and should be in a human editable text file.

1. ABCLI cannot use a DBMS to store data.

1. ABCLI should follow the Object-oriented paradigm primarily.

1. ABCLI should work on the Windows, Linux, and OS-X platforms.

1. ABCLI should work on a computer that has version 17 of Java.

1. ABCLI should work without requiring an installer.

1. ABCLI should not depend on your own remote server.

1. The use of third-party frameworks/libraries/services is allowed but only if they are free, open-source, and have permissive license terms and do not require any installation by users and do not violate other constraints.

1. The GUI should work well for standard screen resolutions 1920x1080 and higher and for screen scales 100% and 125%. In addition, the GUI should be usable for resolutions 1280x720 and higher, and for screen scales 150%.

1. ABCLI has to be packaged into a single JAR file.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

1. _{ more test cases â€¦â€‹ }_

### Deleting a buyer

1. Deleting a buyer while all buyers are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all buyers using the `list` command. Multiple buyers in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No buyer is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

1. _{ more test cases â€¦â€‹ }_

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing / corrupted data files
   1. Under the `data` section, delete 1 or more of the data files before starting the application. 
      Expected: The program will automatically populate the `data` folder with a sample file.

   1. Under the `data` section, add a new parameter into one of the entries in any file.  
      Expected: The program will ignore any saved data from that file and open an empty file.

## **Appendix: Glossary**

### Glossary
1. **ABCLI**  
Our product name.

1. **CLI**  
The command line interface is a way to interact with a computer by typing text commands instead of using a mouse to click on icons.

1. **Command Line**  
A text box where you enter commands.

1. **Database Management System (DBMS)**  
A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that allows users to create, manage, and manipulate databases efficiently. It provides tools for data storage, retrieval, and security, enabling multiple users to access and interact with data in an organized way.

1. **Flag**  
In our context, a flag is something preceded by a /, but is not the initial command. e.g in `add n/NAME`,  `n/` is a flag but `add` is not.

1. **GUI**  
Graphical user interface. The screen you see when opening the application.

1. **JAR file**  
A JAR (Java ARchive) file is a compressed package that bundles multiple Java classes and resources for easier distribution and deployment. It can also be executable if it contains a Main-Class entry, allowing it to be run directly on any system with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

1. [**Java**](https://www.java.com/en/)  
A programming language.

1. **JavaFX**  
JavaFX is a Java library used to build rich, interactive graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for desktop applications. It provides tools for designing and styling UI components and supports modern features like 2D/3D graphics, animation, and media playback.

1. **Non-Functional Requirement**  
A non-functional requirement specifies criteria that judge the operation of a system, such as performance, reliability, and usability. Unlike functional requirements, it focuses on how a system performs rather than what it does.

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which contain data and methods to manipulate that data. It emphasizes principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to build modular, reusable, and organized code.

1. **Parameter**  
A value that you need to provide for the command to work. e.g in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter.

1. **Plant UML**  
PlantUML is a tool that allows users to create diagrams, such as UML diagrams, by writing simple, text-based descriptions that are then converted into visual representations. It supports a range of diagramsâ€”like class, sequence, and activity diagramsâ€”and is often used to quickly illustrate system designs or workflows.

1. **Use Case**  
A use case describes a specific way that a user interacts with a system to achieve a goal, often outlining steps from start to finish. It helps clarify system requirements by detailing the actions, conditions, and outcomes for each interaction scenario.

1. [**Windows**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows)  
An operating system.
