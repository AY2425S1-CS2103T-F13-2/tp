Address Book Command Line Interface (ABCLI) is a **desktop app made specially for Real Estate Agents to manage contacts and is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a real estate agent and can type fast, ABCLI can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer, you can get it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/releases/).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your application.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar abcli.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `view` : Lists all buyers.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com b/120000` : Adds a buyer contact named `John Doe` to the Buyer list.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd buyer shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all buyers.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/relocating` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/relocating`, `t/relocating t/upgrading` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `view`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

## General

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

Data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

All data is saved automatically as a JSON file within the storage folder. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

Note: By default, the storage folder is set to a folder named `data` in the home folder.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes one of the fields invalid, the data files will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
If any of the data files, e.g. `buyerlist.json` is deleted, it will create a new data file with pre-populated data, e.g. it will create a new `buyerlist.json` with prepopulated data.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the JSON files to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Switching parser modes : `switch`

Switches the parser mode to the specified parser mode.

Format: `switch PARSER_MODE`

* Switches the parser mode to the specified `PARSER_MODE`.
* The parser mode takes 3 types:
* `b` for [buyers](#buyers)
* `m` for [meet-ups](#meet-ups)
* `p` for [properties](#properties)
* The default parser mode is set to `b`.

Examples:
* Upon entering the application, the parser mode is set to `b`.
* `switch` followed by `m` switches the parser mode to meet-ups.

![SwitchBuyerToMeetUp](images/SwitchBuyerToMeetUpSequence.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about parser mode-switching:**<br>

* The mode before the switch can be seen at the top bar, where it says `Viewing: Buyers`, after the switch it changes to `Viewing: Meet Ups`.

* The view also automatically changes from showing `Buyers` to `Meet Ups` after the switch command, this view will also change appropriately when switching to `b` or `p`.

* The mode is important for command execution, e.g. to `add` a `Buyer`, you need to be in the `b` mode, to `add` a `MeetUp`, you need to be in the `m` mode, etc.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data files (`buyerlist.json`, `meetuplist.json`, and `propertylist.json`) it creates with the respective files that contain your previous data (which should be in the old `buyerlist.json`, `meetuplist.json`, and `propertylist.json`).

**Q**: Where can I find my local data files?<br>
**A**: In the same folder that contains your app `Abcli.jar`, there should be a folder called `data` which contains `buyerlist.json`, `meetuplist.json`, and `propertylist.json`.

**Q**: How do I add MeetUps or Properties? I can only add buyers<br>
**A**: You are likely in the `Buyer Mode` indicated by the `Viewing: Buyers` shown at the top bar, to switch to `MeetUp Mode`, use `switch m`, and to switch to `Property Mode`, use `switch p`. For more details, see [switching parser modes](#switching-parser-modes--switch).

**Q**: Is there a separate save command/button, are all my changes auto-saved?<br>
**A**: Any successfully inputted command will save the changes into the data files, thus there is no need to worry about manually saving your changes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.


2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
